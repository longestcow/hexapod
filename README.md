# hexapod  
This project is heavily inspired by [Aecert Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/@AecertRobotics).    
My Hexapod uses 18 MG996R Servos, 3 for each of the 6 legs.

Ohter components I'm using are - 2S LiPO Battery, 2xPCA9685, DC Voltage Buck Converter

So far, I have succesfully designed, modelled, printed, and assembled all 6 of the legs of the hexapod.

The next steps include designing and modelling the body of the hexapod, where all 6 legs would be attached to.  
For the software side of the project, I have made a simulation of the hexapod's inverse kinematics in unity, and somewhat sucessfully converted the mechanic to c++ in Arduino.
